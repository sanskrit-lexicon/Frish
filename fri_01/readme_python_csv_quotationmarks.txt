Copilot prompt: does python csv reader remove some quotation marks?

Copilot response:
I understand how working with CSV files can sometimes be tricky, especially when it comes to handling quotation marks. Let me clarify how Python's csv module deals with them.

When you use Python's csv.reader, it does not remove quotation marks arbitrarily. Instead, it follows the CSV format rules, which typically use quotation marks to enclose fields that contain special characters like commas or newlines. Here's a brief example to illustrate:

import csv

data = '''"Name","Age","City"
"John Doe","30","New York"
"Jane Smith","25","Los Angeles"'''

# Simulating reading from a file
from io import StringIO
file = StringIO(data)

reader = csv.reader(file)

for row in reader:
    print(row)


Output:

['Name', 'Age', 'City']
['John Doe', '30', 'New York']
['Jane Smith', '25', 'Los Angeles']


In this example, the csv.reader correctly interprets the quotation marks and parses the fields accordingly. The quotation marks are used to handle fields with special characters but are not included in the final output.

If you encounter issues with quotation marks being removed or not handled as expected, it might be due to the specific formatting of your CSV file or the parameters you use with csv.reader. You can customize the behavior using parameters like quotechar, quoting, and escapechar to better suit your needs.
